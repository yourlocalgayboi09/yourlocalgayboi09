# Hii :3
Hello there! I'm your local gay boi, also known as **YLGB** for short. I go on [MPPNet](https://multiplayerpiano.net/) almost every day, and most likely, you can find me in the room **cheez**.
### A little about me :3
* My birthday is on the 20th of March, 2009. :3
* I am homosexual, of course. (Please don't judge me for it)
### Hobbies!
* I compose music for the piano via [NoteFlight](https://noteflight.com/). (My username is **YLGB**)
* I've been playing the piano since 2020 (I self-taught) and have been composing since 2023 (Also self-taught)
* My favorite composers I adore listening to are **Claude Debussy** and **Maurice Ravel**, both French Impressionists.
* I like doing **Sudoku** in my free time.
### What I code
* I code in **NodeJS** (Self-taught), and I'm looking forward to teach myself other coding languages as well.
